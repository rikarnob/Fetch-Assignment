Hi Fetch Product Team,

I've been analyzing our user and transaction data to understand trends and identify areas for growth.  Here's a summary of my key findings and some data challenges I've encountered:

Key Findings:

**Top Performing Brands**: Coca-Cola and Dove are our top performers, consistently leading in both sales and the number of unique receipts scanned by loyal (21+ years old and 6+ months account tenure) users. This trend remains consistent even when we look at users who have been with us for longer periods (2+ years, 3+ years, etc.).

**Power User Demographics**: Our power users (defined by high spending, frequent app usage, and frequent purchases) are predominantly female (76.4%) and fall within the 35-50 age range (71%).

**Growth Opportunity**: Younger Male Users:  We have a significant opportunity to attract more male users, particularly younger Millennials and Gen Z.  While our overall user base has a female-to-male ratio of 2.6, our power user base has a much higher ratio of 3.25. This suggests we're missing out on a significant potential market of younger male consumers.

Data Challenges faced (for context, these are being addressed):

**Product Barcodes**:  The way product barcodes are stored in our system (using a scientific e^N notation) can sometimes make it tricky to accurately link product information to transactions.  We're working on solutions to ensure data accuracy that includes storing all barcodes as string values to avoid data loss

**User Birthdates**:  We have some missing birthdate information for users, which impacted our ability to do more detailed demographic analysis. A small group of users (72 out of 100,000) are also listed as either over 100 or under 5 years old.

**Transaction Data**:  Some transaction records are missing barcodes, quantities, or final sale amounts. My suspicion is this might have to do with the way receipts are being scanned - I'll work with the engineering team to address this issue and reduce missing data

I'm continuing to investigate these findings and will share further insights and recommendations as I go.  I believe the potential to attract more male users, particularly in the Millennial and Gen Z demographics, represents a significant growth opportunity.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Rik
