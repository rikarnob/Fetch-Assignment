Subject: Data Insights & Potential Growth Opportunities

Hi Fetch Product Team,

I've been analyzing our user and transaction data to understand trends and identify areas for growth.  Here's a summary of my key findings and some data challenges I've encountered:

Key Findings:

Top Performing Brands: Coca-Cola and Dove are our top performers, consistently leading in both sales and the number of unique receipts scanned by loyal (21+ years old and 6+ months account tenure) users. This trend remains consistent even when we look at users who have been with us for longer periods (2+ years, 3+ years, etc.).

Power User Demographics: Our power users (defined by high spending, frequent app usage, and frequent purchases) are predominantly female (76.4%) and fall within the 35-50 age range (71%).

Growth Opportunity: Male Users:  We have a significant opportunity to attract more male users, particularly Millennials and Gen Z.  While our overall user base has a female-to-male ratio of 2.6, our power user base has a much higher ratio of 3.25. This suggests we're missing out on a significant potential market of male consumers.

Data Challenges (for context, these are being addressed):

Product Barcodes:  The way product barcodes are stored in our system (a technical format called "e+N") can sometimes make it tricky to accurately link product information to transactions.  We're working on solutions to ensure data accuracy.  Some barcode data is also missing.

User Birthdates:  We have some missing birthdate information for users, which impacts our ability to do more detailed demographic analysis.

Transaction Data:  Some transaction records are missing barcodes, quantities, or final sale amounts.  This is being investigated to improve data completeness.

User Age Outliers: A small group of users (72 out of 100,000) are listed as either over 100 or under 5 years old.  These appear to be data entry errors and don't have transaction data associated with them, so we're excluding them from relevant analyses to improve data quality.

I'm continuing to investigate these findings and will share further insights and recommendations soon.  I believe the potential to attract more male users, particularly in the Millennial and Gen Z demographics, represents a significant growth opportunity.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Rik
